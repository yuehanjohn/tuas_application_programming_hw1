Make a webapp using Django of following
"A group of friends has a lot of board games they are lending to each other and to other people. However, they have difficulties in remembering who has borrowed them. That’s why they need an application making it possible to keep a registry of the board games, board gamers, and the current game loans. The application should indeed be a web site that would also be open to other board gamers to sign up and start lending board games. The gamers must be able to add, edit and delete their own board games, to see all the games added to the site, to borrow currently free games, to return games they have borrowed, check who has borrowed a certain game, etc. Please note that the application doesn't allow a gamer to have more than 3 borrowed games simultaneously. The application should save enough information about the different entities so that it is easy to answer the questions like “What kinds of high-level characteristics the board game has?” and “Who borrowed the game and when?”. Any gamer trying to borrow the 4th game simultaneously should be clearly informed that he must return at least one of the old games before the system allows him to borrow a new one. The application must also keep record of data creation dates and times, as well as the dates and times of last modifications."
